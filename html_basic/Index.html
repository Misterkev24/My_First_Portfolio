            <h2>Additional Information</h2>
            <p>HTML is a versatile language and is used in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create fully functional websites. Here are some useful resources to get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">MDN Web Docs - HTML</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools - HTML Tutorial</a></li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <article>
            <h2>HTML vs. XHTML</h2>
            <p>HTML and XHTML are both markup languages used for creating web pages. HTML is more lenient with syntax rules, while XHTML enforces stricter rules, making it more consistent but also more challenging for beginners.</p>

            <h3>Key Differences</h3>
            <p>HTML allows for some flexibility with syntax errors and is generally more forgiving. XHTML requires that documents be well-formed XML, meaning that all tags must be properly closed and nested.</p>
